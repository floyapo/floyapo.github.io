		<h1>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</h1>

	<h3>A little less contrast</h3>

	<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

	<h3>Size Matters</h3>

	<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

	<h3>Line-width, motherfucker</h3>

	<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

	<h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

	<p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
